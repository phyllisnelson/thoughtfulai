Strategy: Hash-bucket by (claim_id, status_code) into 128 files
Grouping: Read each bucket, group edges by key
Graph: Deduplicated directed adjacency list per group
SCC: Iterative Tarjan's prunes acyclic nodes
DFS: Backtracking within each SCC for longest simple cycle

Time: O(N) I/O, O(V+E) SCC, O(V*paths) per group
Memory: O(edges/bucket), one bucket at a time
Deps: Python stdlib only
